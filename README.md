# Understanding International Student Flows and Opportunities for Growth

## 📋 Project Overview

This project, completed as part of the BUSA3021 course, was developed for Macquarie International Group to analyze international student flows into Australia and provide strategic recommendations for diversification and growth opportunities.

The objective was to understand historical and current trends, predict future student flows post-COVID, and suggest actionable insights using data visualization and forecasting methods.

## 💡 My Contribution

In this group project, I was responsible for:

Data Analysis: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing student flow data using SQL.

Forecasting Models: Developing predictive models (Linear Regression with dummy variables) to project future student flows.

Data Visualization: Creating Tableau dashboards to visualize trends, market shares, and forecasting outcomes.

Recommendations: Contributing to strategic recommendations using the Maintain, Regain, and Develop framework.

Presentation: Participating in the creation and delivery of the final video presentation.

## 📊 Methodologies Used

### Data Sources:

Australian Government Department of Education

UNESCO Institute for Statistics

Gov.UK, ICE, Statista, and New Zealand Immigration data

### Data Analysis Tools:

SQL for data manipulation and querying

Tableau for visualization

Linear Regression (with dummy variables) for forecasting

### Forecasting Approaches:

Linear Regression with dummy variables (quarters & COVID impact)

Moving Average, Holt’s Exponential Smoothing (explored but not used)

## 📈 Key Findings

### Market Trends:

Australia increased its market share from 7% (2016) to nearly 9% (2019).

Heavy dependence on China and India, which accounted for nearly 30% of all student flows.

### Emerging Markets:

High-growth countries identified: Nepal, Somalia, Yemen.

### Forecasting Insights:

Using a linear regression model with dummy variables, we projected a post-COVID recovery in student flows with an adjustable recovery rate.

## 🚀 Recommendations

Using the Maintain, Regain, and Develop framework:

### Maintain: Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan

### Regain: Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam

### Develop: Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nigeria

### Long-Term Growth: Focus on African countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana for future market expansion.
